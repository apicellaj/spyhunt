    <!-- How To Play Dialog Strings -->
    <string name="how_to_play_info">SpyHunt is played in rounds. Each round players will be given a
    secret location and a role. The locations will be the same (Supermarket) but their roles
    will be different (Cashier, Customer, Butcher). However, one player will receive Spy as their
    role and Unknown for their location.
    \n\n
    The game starts with one player asking another player a question. After a player answers a
    question they get to ask a question to a different player. The goal of the players is to ask
    questions to discover the spy without giving too much about the location away. The goal of the
    spy is to listen closely and guess what the location might be based on the answers of the other
    players.
    \n\n
    Every round each player can stop the clock once and accuse someone of being a spy. If all other
    players (except the accused) agree then the game ends. If the players correctly guess the spy
    then they win, otherwise the spy wins. When the timer runs out a similar vote occurs, but the
    spy can win the game if he or she can guess the location before the timer runs out.</string>
